The set contains 37 industries as listed below.

### Aluminium Plant

<img src="aluminium_plant.png" alt="Aluminium Plant">

The aluminium plant produces aluminium out of bauxite, an aluminium ore. This process consists of two steps, in the first one the bauxite is split up in a chemical process to get rid of impurities in the ore before creating aluminium oxide. The second step then splits up the aluminium oxide using elektrolysis. This requires lots of electricity and produces huge amounts of carbon dioxide. This makes production only viable in places where cheap electricity is available. 

Part of extension: [Aluminium](#aluminium)

Industry will only spawn after 1900.

### Brick works

<img src="brick_works.png" alt="Brick works">

The effective mass production of bricks began in the 19th century with the onset of the industrial revolution. Many manufacturing plants had to be built, and new railway lines often required huge bridges. 

In the real world, bricks have been produced for millenia, often burning wood as source material for creating the required heat. In the set, the modern variant is present which uses coal instead of wood.

### Chloralkali plant

<img src="chloralkali_plant.png" alt="Chloralkali plant">

The chloralkali plant uses electrolysis to split up salt into chlorine and sodium hydroxide. As a byproduct hydrogen is produced. This process was developed in the late 19th century and is one of the most important basic technical processes in the chemical industry. The reaction requires a lot of electric energy. The first plants to implement this process were built around 1890, with multiple plants in Germany, Spain, France and Russia. Today, almost 20 plants are running all over Germany, located mostly in the classic centers of chemical industry such as Ludwigshafen (BASF) and Schkopau (Dow Chemicals), with the biggest plant being located in Stade in northern Germany.

### Clothing Plant

<img src="clothing_plant.png" alt="Clothing Plant">

The clothing plant is the place where textiles are turned into clothing by means of tailoring and sewing. Creating clothing has been common since the stone ages, when animal hides were used. Later on, more refined ways using plant fibres were invented, industrialization revolutionized the way how clothing was created cheaply. Historically, there was a rich history of clothing manufacturing in Europe, which has been replaced almost completely by cheaper Asian competitors, although high quality tailors still have their niche.

### Coal mine

<img src="coal_mine.png" alt="Coal mine">

Coal mining became one of the most important industries during the Industrial Revolution of the early 19th century, as coal was needed to power steam engines. Steam engines in turn were used to pump water out of the mines, allowing to mine much deeper. With the invention of railway steam engines, the demand of coal rose once more. 

Germany's coal mining industry developed mainly in the Ruhr area and in upper Silesia, but also in the Saar region, areas which became the first centers of heavy industrialization. In the early 20th century production increased significantly due to the introduction of improved jackhammers and mechanization. At the time, Germany was one of the largest producers of coal in the world. After World War 2 production peaked in the 1950s. However, rising costs made coal mining unprofitable and the industry slowly declined from 1960 onwards, existing on subsidies for decades. The last coal mines closed in 2018. 

When using the realistic economy model, the maximum production rises slowly in the 19th century, then spikes sharply in the early 20th century, before slowly declining until the early 20th century. 

Industry will only spawn from 1800 to 1950.

### Integrated steel mill

<img src="integrated_steel_mill.png" alt="Integrated steel mill">

Steel is one of the key components in any industrialized economy. It is needed for virtually everything, be it buildings, vehicles, railways, ... Historically, steel production was a key driver of industrialization in the 19th century, especially with the introduction of railways. In Germany, the biggest steel industry centers were located in the Ruhr and Saar regions, where coal was abundant, while iron ore was imported. Nowadays, steel production is still an important part of the economy, requiring iron ore transportation from the ports at the North Sea coast to the mills in the Ruhr area and in Lower Saxony. 

While there are multiple different variants of producing steel out of iron ore, this set only contains the modern variant of the integrated steel mill. There are several steps to create steel out of iron ore, starting with a blast furnace, but molten pig iron is not transported over long distances, and as such it is not relevant in the scope of the game.

Ports are centers of trade, and with the German industry dependent on importing many raw materials and exporting lots of goods, it is only natural to also model this in the set. German ports at the North Sea and the Baltic sea already played pivotal roles in medieval times, when the Hanse ensured that cities like Hamburg and Lübeck (among many others) prospered. 

In the set, the maximum production of harbors is constantly increasing as time goes on. This reflects the fact that ships got bigger and innovations like the switch to containerized transport took place.

Power plants create electricity, typically by boiling water and using the resulting steam to turn turbines which are coupled with generators. This basic principle is also used in nuclear power plants, whereas hydroplants use the water directly for the turbines. Since it is a transportation game, the set concentrates on fossil power plants that require a constant delivery of coal and/or oil to be burned in order to create electricity.

Due to the geological history of northern and central Germany, huge amounts of salt are located underground. There are various springs where salt dissolved in water can be found on ground level, which have been used for centuries to produce salt by simply evaporating the water. However, a major change in the production of salt were the first actual mines which were created in the 19th century in what was then Prussia. To this day, Germany is by far the largest producer of salt in Europe, with the salt being a major economic factor due to its relevance for the chemical industry.

In fact, looms were among the first mechanized items to be developed to improve production speed. In the set, this industry combines the steps of preparing cotton and synthetic fibres into yarn (spinning), and then turning them into textiles (e.g. by weaving) in a second step. The resulting textiles are then used by other industries to manufacture goods.

## Cargos

The set contains 28 cargos as listed below.

### Aluminium

Aluminium is a light metal that is widely used everywhere, where steel is too heavy. It is relevant for building airplanes and cars, but also household items like aluminium foil or cans. Although it is rather ubiquitous on Earth, it is difficult to produce pure aluminium or alloys for technical use. Widespread usage only began in the early 20th century. Germany is one of the largest producers of Aluminium in Europe (and the biggest consumer), even though energy costs are comparably high. Production is nowadays concentrated in only three plants, two in the Ruhr area and one in Hamburg.

Chlorine is a highly reactive chemical element which is relevant for bleaching (e.g. in the production of paper) and disinfecting. Additionally, it is also required for many processes in the chemical industry in general, most importantly to produce a wide range of plastics such as PVC. In higher concentrations chlorine is highly dangerous and poisonous to most living organisms and has historically been used in chemical warfare. Since the early 20th century chlorine is mainly produced by splitting salt using electrolysis in the so-called chloralkali process.

### Electricity

Electricity is not a cargo in the sense that it needs to be transported. Instead, it is produced by power plants and directly distributed to the town that the power plant is located in. The towns themselves require electricity, with the demand increasing as the town size increases. On top of that, certain industries require electricity for production. That in turn means you need to deliver enough coal/oil to the power plants that the demand of the town and the industries in question can be met. This is also shown in the info window of the industries. 

Serious scientific work to understand the nature of electricity only began in the 17th and 18th century, leading to - among other things - the first batteries. It took until the second half of the 19th century to make breakthrough progress in the field of electrical engineering, with the invention of electric engines, lightbulbs and the necessary infrastructure to produce and distribute electricity. The first power plants were built in the late 19th century, powering street lights. Since then, modern life without electricity became impossible, with many household applications such as fridges requiring a constant power supply. Electricity is used in large scale industrial applications as well, mainly in various electrolytic processes, for example in the production of aluminium or in the production of chlorine.

### Grain

Germany is equally famous for the variety in bread and beer, both of which are produced from grain. It is also one of the biggest producers of grain in Europe, being able to fully cover the domestic demand. A large quantity of grain is simply used for feeding livestock, only about a fifth is actually used to create food, and less than 10% are needed to make beer. On top of that, lots of grain is exported, especially wheat.

### Lye

Lye is the common name for various alkaline solutions. They have a wide range of applications in the creation of cleaning agents and soaps, but also in the food industry. A huge percentage of lye is industrially used in the paper industry, but it also sees widespread application in the production of dyes and bleaches. Lye, at least in the form of sodium hydroxide, is produced by splitting salt using electrolysis in the so-called chloralkali process.

### Mail

Transporting mail has always been one of the main tasks of any transportation networks. Mail coaches had been in use for hundreds of years, only to be replaced by railway lines and later on by trucks. While the number of letters and postcards being sent has been declining in the 21st century - being replaced by phone calls and message services via Internet - mail carriers are now in more demand than ever to transport packages from online shopping.

### Oil

Oil was already known in ancient Babylon. During the 19th century it was mainly used to produce petroleum, which in turn was used as lamp oil. It was only with the invention of internal combustion engines and their dependence on fuel that crude oil became the economic and political factor that it is today. 

Apart from being used as fuel and simply being burned, oil of course is the base for for what became known as petrochemicals. This started in the 1920s with synthetic rubber for tyres, in the late 1930s nylon fibers were invented, and today oil based plastics can be found just about everywhere. 

With so many uses, demand was ever increasing, and today the German industry is almost entirely dependent on oil imports, which is not only an economic issue, but also has great political implications.

### Passengers

Whether it's business trips or vacation - people need and want to travel. While for centuries travelling was limited to walking or riding, technical innovations were mainly driven by increasing travel speed. This led to building harbors, road and railway networks, and finally airports. Travel not only became faster, but also cheaper - allowing trips that were unthinkable not so long ago.

### Plastics

Plastics are a range of synthetic materials created mainly from crude oil. They were invented in the early 20th century and provided cheap, lightweight and durable materials for just about anything imaginable. Most of it is used for packaging, but it is also used for construction (pipes), in all sorts of machinery from hoovers to cars as well as furniture and toys - Lego bricks for example. 

In the set, this also incorporate synthetic materials that do not have the characteristic plasticity, so it also includes fibers which are relevant for clothing, like nylon and polyester.

### Salt

Salt has been used since ancient times to conserve food. Up until the end of middle ages, salt was treated as white gold and it played a pivotal role in trade, taxes and economy in general. This only changed when mining salt became possible due to improved technical means in the 19th century. Salt mining in Germany began in 1839 in the city of Staßfurt, and even today Germany is by far the biggest producer of salt in Europe. Additionally, with the progress of science and chemistry in the 19th century, salt became an all-important raw material to produce chlorine, lye and soda, which in turn are some of the most important basic chemicals for industrial purposes. Today, about 80% of the salt mined in Germany is used for industrial purposes, less than 5% are used for in the food industry.

### Steel

Steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon, has already been produced more than 2000 years ago, mainly in Asia. In the 16th and 17th century, industrial steel production began in Europe, especially in the Great Britain. Technical innovations in the 19th century led to a process of converting pig iron to steel, allowing a cheap mass production of high quality steel. Likewise, demand increased exponentially, as steel was needed for railways, replaced wood to build bigger ships, and is also needed for buildings, bridges and many other structures. 

The first steel production plant in Germany was founded in the early 19th in Essen in the middle of the Ruhr area, which later evolved into the Krupp steelworks company. Today, Germany is by far the biggest producer of steel in Europe. Economic pressure has led to many plants being closed or combined into highly integrated plants to reduce energy consumption and make use of byproducts.

### Vehicles

In the broadest sense, a vehicle is a self-propelled land-vehicle used to transport people and/or cargo. In the game, it basically means cars. 

These are produced by vehicle factories and need to be transported to dealerships and to harbours for export. Cars are one of the most important goods to be produced and exported in Germany. From the point of gameplay, they also offer a specific challenge, since they require specific railcars and trucks for transportation.

### Wood

Wood has been used by the first humans already, be it to build hunting spears or to kindle fires. Then buildings were made of wood, ships were built, and it was figured out how to produce paper. Today, wood is still an important resource, gaining new importance due to its regenerative nature. 

Germany always had lots of forests and thus wood always was an economic factor. Today, Germany is the biggest producer of paper in Europe and also has a relevant furniture industry.
