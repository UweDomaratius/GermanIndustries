# GermanIndustries documentation

## Concepts

### Economy settings

By default, the economy is stable. No industries will simply close (except for excavating industries running out of raw materials to excavate), but new industries are randomly created.
This can be influenced by parameters.

Even if industry closures are allowed, no industry that is actively producing (stockpile is not empty, there was some production in recent time) will simply close down.
Only industries that have an empty stockpile and have not produced anything in 12 months run a small risk of being closed.

Independently from that, a realistic economy setting can be enabled by a parameter. This only influences the maximum production levels of industries. For example, historically, coal production in Germany
peaked in the 1950s and slowly declined since then. This is also modelled in the set for excavating industries. Secondary industries are not affected by this setting, their production only depends on the amount of delivered raw materials.

Some industries are only available in a certain time frame. Mines for example will not be available before 1800, modelling the fact that only the introduction of steam engines allowed constant water pumping to allow for deeper mining.
Certain chemical industries are only available from the middle of the 19th century, and vehicle production starts in 1910. Historically, certain industries have been given up over time, e.g. oil wells or coal mines.
That means the set will not create new industries of these types after certain years.

### Electricity

If the corresponding setting is enabled, some industries require electricity to produce anything.
Electricity is "produced" by power plants.
Technically, electricity is no cargo that can be transported, the distribution is done automatically.

Each industry belongs to exactly one city. Same for power stations. The electricity that is provided by a power station is distributed to the city and can be accessed by all industries belonging to that city.
Electricity demand depends on the size of the city (the bigger the city, the more electricity it will need) and on production levels of the industry.
If the power plant provides enough electricity, everything is fine. If not, industry production will be reduced or - in the worst case - completely stopped.
The relevant information is shown from the industry window of the industries and power plants.

<img src="electricity_power_station_en.png">

The power plant shows the current demand and production levels. Demand is - as explained above - the sum of a base value depending on town size and the combined demands of all industries in that town.

<img src="electricity_no_power_en.png">
<img src="electricity_not_enough_power_en.png">
<img src="electricity_100_en.png">

These three screenshots show the same industry in different situations - no power available, some power available (but not enough to produce at full capacity) and enough power available.

### Modularity

The set is designed to be modular.
The basic industry chain is rather simple and comparable to the original industry chain.
However, you can now activate extensions via parameter.
These extensions add further industries and cargos, and also modify existing industries.
That way, each player can configure the set according to their personal taste.
One player may wish to play on a small map with few industries, another one wants to play on a huge map with many different industries, and others may want to focus on certain kinds of industries.
Most extensions can be enabled independently from the others.

### Production levels

Primary industries (those that do not require raw materials, e.g. mines, farms, oil wells), will increase their production if a high percentage of the produced cargo is transported.
Over time, production will simply increase or decrease to match the transport capacities.

Industries that depend on raw materials (see [Stockpiling](#stockpiling) will take 10% of the available stockpile for production with each production event (around 8 times per month, assuming default settings).
So when e.g. 100t raw material is available, the first production event will consume 10t, leaving 90t remaining. The next production event will consume 9t, leaving 81t.
This continues until the stockpile is depleted.

The output then depends on the amount of raw materials consumed, and on the industry itself. Each industry has custom hardcoded values related to which percentage of the input is converted into output.
Chemical industries for example may produce not just one output, but also carbon dioxide or other waste, which is then of course not part of the output.

On top of that, industry output may depend on the number of different raw materials that are delivered. The basic food processor for example produces food from grain, livestock and fish, but you do not need to
provide them all - it will start producing if any of these cargos is stockpiled. However, the output is reduced. If you provide all three raw materials, production output will increase drastically.

Each industry provides information on the dependencies in the information window.

<img src="industry_any_en.png">

This industry depends on multiple raw materials, but starts production as soon as any raw material is available.

<img src="industry_optional_en.png">

This industry has optional input materials. It depends on all the materials marked in black, but overall production is limited as long as the optional cargo is unavailable.

<img src="industry_optional_any_en.png">

This industry has optional input materials, but starts production as soon as any of the mandatory materials is available.
Overall production level increases with the number of different raw materials available.

<a name="resource_depletion"></a>
### Resource depletion

Extractive industries such as mines and oil wells are generated with a random amount of raw materials to excavate. The industry then produces, and over time the raw materials become less and less.
Once no more raw materials are available, the industry will close. The industry information window shows how much material is left and how long this will last if production levels do not change.

<img src="resource_depletion_en.png">

The screenshot shows how the information is displayed.
This should allow the player to properly plan ahead.

<a name="stockpiling"></a>
### Stockpiling

Most industries require raw materials to produce anything. Depending on industry, different models of dependencies are applied.
In the most simple case, the industry requires all listed raw materials. For example, the basic steel mill without any extensions activated requires both coal and iron ore. If only one is supplied, it
will simply be stockpiled, but not used for production.

Some industries have optional raw material. These are marked in white in the stockpile list. Optional raw materials are not needed to produce anything, but they will increase the output.

The maximum size of the stockpile is hard coded in the game at 65.535 units. If you reach that limit, nothing much will happen, the next delivery of raw materials will simply be discarded (but you will get paid).
However, since production scales with stockpile size, it should be hard to run into that limit, unless you deliberately miss on delivering relevant raw materials so that nothing will get produced at all.

## Parameters

The set comes with a number of parameters to customize and tweak the behavior:

- The production of excavating industries (mines, oil wells, ...) can be scaled to fit your needs. Depending on the vehicle set in use, a higher or lower production may be desirable.
- The economy model (stable or realistic). This influences the production levels of excavating industries, as e.g. coal mines reached their peak production in Germany already in the 1950s. With the realistic model,
production will then decline, regardless of how well you serve the industries.
- Enable or disable that certain industries require electricity for production. See also [Electricity](#electricity).
- Forbid industry generation. When enabled, no new industries will spawn after the initial map generation. The player can still fund new industries.
- Forbid industry closure. When enabled, no industries will ever close. When disabled, industries that have not seen any service in 12 months run a risk of closing down.
- Enable/disable the various extensions. Each of these adds further cargos and industries and changes the industry chains. See [Extensions](#extensions) for a detailed listing.

## Basic delivery chain

The set comes with a basic set of industries and cargos. These are listed as follows:

[Coal](#cargo_COAL) [Fish](#cargo_FISH) [Food](#cargo_FOOD) [Goods](#cargo_GOOD) [Grain](#cargo_GRAI) [Iron Ore](#cargo_IORE) [Livestock](#cargo_LVST) [Mail](#cargo_MAIL) [Oil](#cargo_OIL_) [Passengers](#cargo_PASS) [Plastics](#cargo_PLAS) [Sand](#cargo_SAND) [Steel](#cargo_STEL) [Timber](#cargo_WDPR) [Vehicles](#cargo_VEHI) [Wood](#cargo_WOOD)

<img src="base_industry_chain_en.png" alt="The basic industry chain">

If an industry box contains a year, it is the first year that this industry can be generated/funded. If the box contains two years it contains the start and end year of the range in which this industry can be generated/funded.

The colors of the arrows match with the colors used in the industry chain view in the game (except for electricity, which is not a cargo to be transported, see [Electricity](#electricity)).
Unless mentioned in the industry box, the industry requires all incoming cargos to be present in order to produce anything.

## Extensions

<img src="base_industries_with_extensions_en.png" alt="The industry chains with extensions">

The image depicts the interactions between the different extensions. Each extension uses a different color here. If the extension is not enabled, you can ignore the arrows connected to it.
A cargo shown in a colored box is part of the extension of the same color, so if that extension is not enabled, the cargo is not active either.
For each extension, an extra diagram is available to see the detailed connections between their cargos and industries.

The set contains 10 extensions as listed below.

### Aluminium

Aluminium is a light metal discovered in 1825. By the end of the 19th century, mass-production had been started, and during the 20th century, it became the most important non-ferrous metal for industrial applications. It is way lighter than steel, an excellent conductor and can be be formed and shaped rather easily. Without aluminium, aviation is pretty much impossible. Similarly, it has widespread usage in the automobile sector, and of course it is a household item in the form of aluminium foil and cans. Production of Aluminium is concentrated in Southeast Asia and Australia, Norway is the largest producer in Europe.

### Basic Inorganic Chemistry

Inorganic chemistry covers chemical compounds that are not carbon-based. This includes countless minerals, acids, lyes and of course metals. With the progress of chemistry, these fields became increasingly relevant, as a wide range of industries require various chemicals. Historically, the production levels of sulfuric acid and chlorine were indicators for the industrialization of a country. This extension introduces a number of base chemical compounds and their production industries, which are a prerequisite for other extensions.

### Building Industries

Masonry, the craft of constructing walls and buildings from stone, is one of the oldest achievements of human civilization. Starting from burning bricks from mud in ancient times a whole industry evolved. In the 19th century, industrial level production of bricks were needed for all the new industrial buildings. Stone bridges such as the famous Göltzschtalbrücke in Saxony, the largest brick-built bridge in the world, give testament to the relevance of these industries in the 19th century. Bricks finally gave way to cement and concrete, allowing the construction of modern skyscrapers.

### Organic Chemistry

Organic chemistry is the science of carbohydrates, compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen. The base materials (coal and most importantly crude oil) were created from organic matter (e.g. plants) over millions of years. In the 20th century crude oil became one of the most important resources of mankind, as it is indispensable for the production of fuels and plastics. Each day, several billions of liters of crude oil are consumed for industrial purposes.

### Painting Industries

For thousands of years, paints and pigments such as Indigo had been produced from plants and various powders, which made it prohibitely expensive for industrial scale uses. The production of artificial colors was one of the first important uses of the chemical industry. In fact, some of the biggest chemical companies in Germany started as producers of paints and dyes, such as Agfa and BASF (both derived parts of their name from Anilin, a base chemical used in the production of paints). In 1925 the biggest German chemical companies joined together in the so-called I.G. Farben (literally "interest group paint industries"), which became the biggest chemical company in the world prior to World War 2. Even today, paints, dyes, pigments and related products are a staple of the chemical industry and see wide uses in many other areas, be it textile, plastics production, construction or in the automobile sector.

### Textile Industries

The production of yarns and textiles to create clothes was one of the very first cultural achievements of mankind. Sources for the production include various natural sources such as wool from sheep and other animals as well as cotton and other plants. With the innovations of the chemical industry in the 20th century, artificial fibers such as polyester became available. 

Textile manufacturing was a laborious process and was among the first to be affected heavily by industrialization in the 18th century in England. Germany also had a strong textile manufacturing industry in Saxony and Silesia, which in turn benefitted from industrialization. Chemnitz in Saxony became a center of mechanical engineering with a focus on the production of machines for the textile industry. However, since the middle of the 20th century, the industry is shrinking, and nowadays most of the textile industry has moved to Asia for cost-related reasons.

## Cargos

The set contains 39 cargos as listed below.

<a name="cargo_ALUM"></a>
### Aluminium

Aluminium is a light metal that is widely used everywhere, where steel is too heavy. It is relevant for building airplanes and cars, but also household items like aluminium foil or cans. Although it is rather ubiquitous on Earth, it is difficult to produce pure aluminium or alloys for technical use. Widespread usage only began in the early 20th century. Germany is one of the largest producers of Aluminium in Europe (and the biggest consumer), even though energy costs are comparably high.

### Bricks

Bricks have been used for all sorts of masonry construction since ancient times. With the onset of industrialization in the 19th century, demand arose for mass-produced cheap bricks to build factory buildings, bridges and many other structures. Even today, bricks are still relevant, although they cannot be used for skyscrapers for structural reasons.

### Chlorine

Chlorine is a highly reactive chemical element which is relevant for bleaching (e.g. in the production of paper) and disinfecting. Additionally, it is also required for many processes in the chemical industry in general, most importantly to produce a wide range of plastics such as PVC. In higher concentrations chlorine is highly dangerous and poisonous to most living organisms and has historically been used in chemical warfare. Since the early 20th century chlorine is mainly produced by splitting salt using electrolysis in the so-called chloralkali process.

### Coal

Coal was the main driver of industrializaton in the 19th century, being required to power steam engines. With the introduction of railway steam engines and later on power plants to produce electricity, the demand for coal rose rapidly. 

Germany had relevant coal deposits, and the areas were coal was mined became industrial centers, such as the Ruhr area and Silesia. Coal remained important throughout the 20th century, but it was phased out in many areas for environmental reasons.

### Ethylene

Ethylene is a carbohydrate, which is one of the most important base chemicals in the industry, with a production volume of more than 100 million tons per year. About half of it is needed in the production of polyethylene, a plastic. The typical way to produce ethylene is by using the process of steam cracking. Other processes like coal liquefaction or using biomass are also in use. 

While there are various pipelines in Europe to transport ethylene e.g. between Rotterdam/Antwerp and Ludwigshafen, the player has to figure out the transportation themselves.

### Glass

Glass is the common name for a group of materials that have puzzling physical properties. Many solid matters exhibit an ordered molecular structure, some sort of grid if you will. Glass however, does not follow this character, it keeps an unordered molecular structure, which is usually only found in liquids. Though it's not really understood on physical level even today, glass has been known for thousands of years. 

Typically, when talking about glass, one talks about transparent material made from silica. It is extremly stable in a chemical sense, making it a prime material for all sorts of containers of liquids, even hazardous ones. In fact, glass is ubiquitous in todays life. It is used for windows, for bottles and glasses, and of course in optical equipment such as lenses, mirrors, and last but not least glasses for eyesight correction.

Germany is equally famous for the variety in bread and beer, both of which are produced from grain. It is also one of the biggest producers of grain in Europe, being able to fully cover domestic demand. A large quantity of grain is simply used for feeding livestock, only about a fifth is actually used to create food, and less than 10% are needed to make beer. On top of that, lots of grain is exported, especially wheat.

### Oil

Oil was already known in ancient Babylon. During the 19th century it was mainly used to produce petroleum, which in turn was used as lamp oil. It was only with the invention of internal combustion engines and their dependence on fuel that crude oil became the economic and political factor that it is today. 

Apart from being used as fuel and simply being burned, oil of course is the base for what became known as petrochemicals. This started in the 1920s with synthetic rubber for tyres, in the late 1930s nylon fibers were invented, and today oil based plastics can be found just about everywhere. 

With so many uses, demand was ever increasing, and today the German industry is almost entirely dependent on oil imports, which is not only an economic issue, but also has great political implications.

Paints are as old as mankind, having been used already to create cave-paintings tens of thousands of years ago. Lots of different paints have been known since ancient times, often times being very expensive due to the rarity of the organic ingredients like plant leaves. With the development of modern chemistry, all sorts of compounds were developed to create synthetic paints and dyes, which see a wide range of applications. Just to name a few, lots of paints and coatings are needed in the automobile industry, while dyes are used in the textile industry, among many others. They are also simply household items, as paints are used to color walls and inks are used for writing.

### Quicklime

Quicklime, chemically speaking, is calcium oxide. The substance is highly reactive with moisture in the air. Similarly, it will react with moisture on human skin, causing dangerous chemical burns. The reaction also emits heat, which makes it a relevant fire hazard. It is a key ingredient in the creation of mortars and cement, but also sees use as fertilizer or desinfectant. The most important use is in the steel production where it is used to remove sulphur from the intermediate iron products.

### Salt

Salt has been used since ancient times to conserve food. Up until the end of middle ages, salt was treated as white gold and it played a pivotal role in trade, taxes and economy in general. This only changed when mining salt became possible due to improved technical means in the 19th century. Additionally, with the progress of science and chemistry in the 19th century, salt became an all-important raw material to produce chlorine, lye and soda, which in turn are some of the most important basic chemicals for industrial purposes. Today, about 80% of the salt mined in Germany is used for industrial purposes, less than 5% are used in the food industry.

### Steel

Steel, which is an alloy of iron and carbon, has already been produced more than 2000 years ago, mainly in Asia. In the 16th and 17th century, industrial steel production began in Europe, especially in England. Technical innovations in the 19th century led to a process of converting pig iron to steel, allowing a cheap mass production of high quality steel. Likewise, demand increased exponentially, as steel was needed for railways, replaced wood to build bigger ships, and is also needed for buildings, bridges and many other structures. 

The first steel production plant in Germany was founded in the early 19th century in Essen in the middle of the Ruhr area, which later evolved into the Krupp steelworks company. Today, Germany is by far the biggest producer of steel in Europe.

### Wood

Wood has been used by the first humans already, be it to build hunting spears or to kindle fires. Then buildings were made of wood, ships were built, and it was figured out how to produce paper. Today, wood is still an important resource, gaining new importance due to its regenerative nature. 

Germany always had lots of forests and thus wood always was an economic factor. Today, Germany is the biggest producer of paper in Europe and also has a relevant furniture industry.

### Aluminium Plant

<img src="aluminium_plant.png" alt="Aluminium Plant">

The aluminium plant produces aluminium out of bauxite, an aluminium ore. This process consists of two steps, in the first one the bauxite is split up in a chemical process to get rid of impurities in the ore before creating aluminium oxide. The second step then splits up the aluminium oxide using elektrolysis. This requires lots of electricity and produces huge amounts of carbon dioxide. This makes production only viable in places where cheap electricity is available. 

In Germany, there is only one actual company left that still produces Aluminium. It operates three plants which mainly produce Aluminium from scrap metal.

### Brewery

<img src="brewery.png" alt="Brewery">

The production of beer has been known for thousands of years. Often called liquid bread, beer was and is a common part of the human diet. In the middle ages, monasteries were the typical locations where beer was produced. During Industrial Revolution, with the introduction of better materials such as stainless steel, the number of breweries as well as the production volume of beer increased dramatically. The breakthrough technology was the invention of a refrigeration machine in the 19th century, allowing beer to be produced in higher summer temperatures. Before that, beer was produced during winter and then stored in cellars to shield it from summer heat. 

Germany has a long tradition of brewing beer, and beer is a large part of German culture. It is one of the largest producers and consumers of beer in Europe There a famous regulations dictating that only hops, certain types of grain, yeast and water must be used in the production of beer. Still, there are countless breweries, especially in Franconia, which has the highest density of breweries in the world. About 5000 different beer types are produced across some 1500 breweries, half of which are located in Bavaria. Beer festivals are also famous, among them the Oktoberfest in Munich or the Bergkirchweih in Erlangen. 

In the set, beer is not an extra type of freight, but it is simply labeled as food.

This process was developed in the late 19th century and is one of the most important basic technical processes in the chemical industry, as both the main products chlorine and sodium hydroxide are needed practically everywhere in the chemical industry. The reaction requires a lot of electric energy. The first plants to implement this process were built around 1890, with multiple plants in Germany, Spain, France and Russia. Today, almost 20 plants are running all over Germany, located mostly in the classic centers of chemical industry such as Ludwigshafen (BASF) and Schkopau (Dow Chemicals), with the biggest plant being located in Stade in northern Germany.

### Coal Liquefaction Plant

<img src="coal_liquefaction_plant.png" alt="Coal Liquefaction Plant">

Creating fuels by liquifying coal in combination with hydrogen is a bit of a special case in the German history of chemistry. As Germany does not have own reserves of crude oil, it was a political goal since the early 20th century to overcome this dependency. The first fuel created synthetically this way was the so-called Leuna-Benzin ("Leuna-fuel"), named after the location of the plant. These plants were important for the preparation of World War II in Nazi Germany and thus were extended heavily. After the end of the war the relevance of this process practically vanished, since fuels can be produced much cheaper from oil, which was now available in abundance via imports. However, in the 21st century many countries see that this process may be a way to reduce the dependency on oil imports, with all its political implications.

### Coal Mine

<img src="coal_mine.png" alt="Coal Mine">

Coal mining became one of the most important industries during the Industrial Revolution of the early 19th century, as coal was needed to power steam engines. Steam engines were used to power just about anything, from water pumps in mines to mechanized looms. With the invention of railway steam engines and the introduction of steam shipping the demand of coal rose once more. 

Germany's coal mining industry developed mainly in the Ruhr area and in upper Silesia, but also in the Saar region, areas which became the first centers of heavy industrialization. In the early 20th century production increased significantly due to the introduction of improved jackhammers and mechanization. At the time, Germany was one of the largest producers of coal in the world. After World War 2 production peaked in the 1950s. However, rising costs made coal mining unprofitable and the industry slowly declined from 1960 onwards, existing on subsidies for decades. The last coal mines closed in 2018. 

Industry will only spawn from 1800 to 1950.

Mining copper ore has been done since ancient times. In the set, as with all mining, the starting time is set way later in order to simulate the improved mining technologies required to do really deep mining. Europe in general does not contain a lot of copper ore, mining was done in central Germany, but the reserves were already depleted even before the industrial revolution. The last copper ore mines were in production until the middle of the 20th century, but that had at least partially political reasons, with East Germany not having access to copper on the world market. Today, copper is mainly produced from imported ore and by recycling scrap metal.

The department store implements the concept of generic stores where you can buy any sort of item in the household, be it clothing, books, household applications like washing machines, toys and whatever else. They are introduced to avoid the problem that small towns typically do not accept goods until they have grown to a certain size and to avoid a fluctuation in accepted cargo for your stations.

Fish has to be caught out on sea, which provides for an interesting transportation challenge, requiring ships and possibly transfers from ships to other means of transportation at ports. Although Germany has access to the North Sea and Baltic Sea, it imports most fish from elsewhere. In fact, Germany is one of the biggest importers of fish in Europe.

### Flour Mill

Flour mills have been around for thousands of years. They grind grain into flour, which is an all-important ingredient for many types of food. This grinding involved a rotating stone, the millstone, which was typically achieved by using water or wind for power. Mills were ubiquitous, as is the surname Miller, which was derived from the job of running the mill. Industrialization changed the process of creating flour considerably, providing new power sources and allowing much larger production volumes.

### Integrated Steel Mill

<img src="integrated_steel_mill.png" alt="Integrated Steel Mill">

Historically, steel production was a key driver of industrialization in the 19th century, especially with the introduction of railways. In Germany, the biggest steel industry centers were located in the Ruhr and Saar regions, where coal was abundant, while iron ore was imported. Nowadays, steel production is still an important part of the economy, requiring iron ore transportation from the ports at the North Sea coast to the mills in the Ruhr area and in Lower Saxony. 

While there are multiple different variants of producing steel out of iron ore, this set only contains the modern variant of the integrated steel mill. There are several steps to create steel out of iron ore, starting with a blast furnace, but molten pig iron is not transported over long distances, and as such it is not relevant in the scope of the game.

### Lime Kiln

<img src="lime_kiln.png" alt="Lime Kiln">

A lime kiln is a kind of oven used for the process of calcination of limestone. This reaction turns limestone into so-called quicklime. Chemically speaking, calcium carbonate is turned into calcium oxide. Note that the lime is not burned, but merely subjected to lots of heat. This process has been known for thousands of years, with quicklime being a key ingredient in the production of cement. The kiln is typically heated by burning all sorts of fossil fuels, which adds to the already sum of carbon dioxide emissions inherent to the reaction.

Oil refineries split up crude oil into its different components, which in turn are relevant base materials for the chemical industry. The refineries not only produce a variety of fuels, but also liquid gas, lubricants and heating oil. Additionally, the crude oil is filtered and sulphuric compounds are removed. A real refinery then has subsequent steps and processes to further split up the products of the first stage, so that a refinery can produce a huge variety of compounts. In the set, these additional steps have been moved out into their own industries (steam reformer and steam cracker), so that the player can control how much fuel, hydrogen and ethylen are to be produced.

### Oil Wells

<img src="oil_well.png" alt="Oil Wells">

It's a little known fact that the first actual deep drilling for oil happened in Germany in the late 1850s, even before an oil boom started in North America. Oil wells are still running in some places in Northern Germany (mainly in Lower Saxony), but many locations have been closed already in the 1960s, with oil imports becoming increasingly cheaper. 

Industry will only spawn from 1860 to 1985.

### Paper Mill

<img src="paper_mill.png" alt="Paper Mill">

The paper mill splits up wood using various chemicals, to retrieve cellulose fibers which are the basis for the production of paper. The process of making paper has been known for thousands of years, but the modern paper production only started in the late 19th century with advances in chemistry. Germany is one of the biggest producers of paper in the world, and the biggest one in Europe. The paper mill in the set shows such a paper mill that uses chemicals to break down the wood and to bleach the resulting paper.

### Petrol Station

<img src="petrol_station.png" alt="Petrol Station">

The first petrol station was a pharmacy in Wiesloch in southwest Germany - Bertha Benz bought some light fuel there when she did the first lengthy travel from Mannheim to Pforzheim in 1888. The first actual petrol stations as we know them today were built after World War I, but then spread rapidly throughout the world. At the time, it was usual to have service personnel fueling the car, and also checking the oil and coolants as well as cleaning the windshield. Today, a dense network of petrol stations is one of the most important parts of industrial infrastructure.

Today, Hamburg still is the busiest port in Germany. 

In the set, the maximum production of harbors is constantly increasing as time goes on. This reflects the fact that ships got bigger and innovations like the switch to containerized transport took place.

Ports are centers of trade, and with the German industry dependent on importing many raw materials and exporting lots of goods, it is only natural to also model this in the set. German ports at the North Sea and the Baltic sea already played pivotal roles in medieval times, when the Hanse ensured that cities like Hamburg and Lübeck (among many others) prospered. Today, Hamburg still is the busiest port in Germany. 

In the set, the maximum production of harbors is constantly increasing as time goes on. This reflects the fact that ships got bigger and innovations like the switch to containerized transport took place.

### Power Station

<img src="power_plant.png" alt="Power Station">

Power plants create electricity, typically by boiling water and using the resulting steam to turn turbines which are coupled with generators. This basic principle is also used in nuclear power plants, whereas hydroplants use the water directly for the turbines. Since it is a transportation game, the set concentrates on fossil power plants that require a constant delivery of coal and/or oil to be burned in order to create electricity. 

Industry will only spawn after 1880.

### Salt Mine

<img src="salt_mine.png" alt="Salt Mine">

Due to the geological processes there are huge amounts of salt located underground in northern and central Germany. There are various springs where salt dissolved in water can be found on ground level, which have been used for centuries to produce salt by simply evaporating the water. However, a major change in the production of salt were the first actual mines which were created in the 19th century The first actual salt mine was created in Staßfurt, then Prussia, in 1855. The whole area today belongs to a district literally named salt land, with a huge mine located in neighboring Bernburg being active since about 1920. Other mines exist in Lower Saxony and in Southern Germany. To this day, Germany is by far the largest producer of salt in Europe, with the salt being a major economic factor due to its relevance for the chemical industry.

### Steamcracker

<img src="steamcracker.png" alt="Steamcracker">

Oil refineries produce large amounts of so-called naphtha, or crude oil. The chemical industry however, requires lots of compounds that can be won out of naphtha. To do that, it has to be heated to above 800°C, so that the naphtha is actually in a gaseous state, hence the name of the process. The products of the process are a variety of carbohydrates which are essential for the production of plastics, among other things.

### Steamreformer

<img src="steamreformer.png" alt="Steamreformer">

Steam reforming is based on an idea by Carl Bosch, who was looking for a cheap way to produce hydrogen. The process basically consists of splitting carbohydrates, usually natural gas, into carbon dioxide and hydrogen by adding heat and water. About 50% of the hydrogen needed for industrial purposes are produced this way. About 60% of this hydrogen is then used for the synthesis of ammonia. 

Since natural gas is not part of the set, naphtha, a crude oil, is used as a base.

### Textile Mill

<img src="textile_mill.png" alt="Textile Mill">

Textile mills are the representation of multiple real world industries that are focused on the creation of yarns and fabrics. This has been done since ancient times in household work before it became mechanized in the 18th and 19th century. In fact, looms were among the first mechanized items to be developed to improve production speed. In the set, this industry combines the steps of preparing cotton and synthetic fibres into yarn (spinning), and then turning them into textiles (e.g. by weaving) in a second step. The resulting textiles are then used by other industries to manufacture goods.
