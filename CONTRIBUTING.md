# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the development of the set, there are a couple of ways to do so.

## Issues

If you think you found a bug or the set is missing something, check the [Issues](https://github.com/UweDomaratius/GermanIndustries/issues) section and create a new issue if necessary.

Please check if your issue may already exist there to avoid duplications.

In case of a bug report, please provide the exact version of the set that you encountered the bug in, as well as the exact configuration (NewGRF settings).
Without these, and especially without knowing which extensions you turned on or off, it will be impossible to figure out the problem.
If possible, provide screenshots of any error message.

## Providing changes

In case you feel like contributing to the set development, feel free to fork the repository and provide your input as a new [pull request](https://github.com/UweDomaratius/GermanIndustries/pulls).

As for the pull request, please describe properly what the change is supposed to be doing.
In the most simple case it can be something like "added a translation to ...", in more complicated cases a more elaborate description may be needed.

In case you wish to change central mechanics of the set (add or remove industries or cargos, change which cargos are accepted by which industry), you should get in touch with me beforehand to clarify if I would accept such a change into the set at all.
